Stack is used in place where we have two loop and the second loop 
depends on the first loop (i goes from start to end and j goes from i+1 \
to the end), hence the complexcity in the brute force solution is n^2 
by using stack the complexcity is reduced to n since we get the solution
in one iteration but the space complexcity increasing to n since the worst case the stack will contain all the elements present in the array.

time  = O(n)
space = O(n)
